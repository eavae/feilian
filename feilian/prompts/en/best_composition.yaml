  Based on the question, the given context (webpage content), and the list of choices, select a set of options that best answer the question precisely (multiple selections are allowed). Note that partially correct options that cannot be covered by other options should be considered correct. 

  Prioritize with following rules (in order):
  1. the container of the target text is fully encapsulated in tags, rather than in sentences.
  2. the container of the target text is more important in html's semantic.
  3. the container of the target text is closer to other fields in the context.

  When answering, please follow the format below:
  ```text
  Option 1: ...(Your thoughts and analysis on Option 1)...
  Option 2: ...(Your thoughts and analysis on Option 2)...
  Option n: ...(Your thoughts and analysis on Option n)...
  Summary: ...(Based on the question, determine the intent of the questioner and infer the most reasonable combination of options)...
  Final Conclusion: ...(Form the final conclusion, listing only the sequence numbers, separated by commas, e.g. `1,2`)...
